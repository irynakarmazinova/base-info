How to access the server from Mobile?

First, make a sure that your PC & Mobile are connected through same network.

Windows : Open CMD and enter ipconfig.
Linux/macOS : Open terminal and enter ifconfig.
And note down the IPv4 Address (probably it will look like 192.168.xx.xx). This is your PC's IP address. Enter the address to your browser's URL Bar with the port number**.

    http://<IP Address> : <Port>
** For an example, if your server running at http:// 127.0.0.1:3500 on PC then port number is 3500.
